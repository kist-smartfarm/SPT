# SPT

This repository contains the image data used in the study **"Development of a Deep-Learning Phenotyping Tool for Analyzing Image-Based Strawberry Phenotypes,"** designated as **"SPT."**

The dataset comprises high-quality images of key phenotypic traits (crown diameter, petiole length, plant height, flower, leaf, and fruit size), which were utilized for training, validation, and testing of the two SPT versions. Additionally, it includes a validation dataset consisting of 70 sample  images per phenotype with their corresponding quantitative measurements obtained via conventional methods. These real quantitative data were measured the same day as  the image sampling to serve as  reference and were used to calibrate and evaluate the phenotyping tool's accuracy.
